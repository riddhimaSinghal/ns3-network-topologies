Lab: Network Topology Creation using ns-3

Topologies Implemented:
1. Star Topology – 15 nodes
2. Bus Topology – 20 nodes
3. Ring Topology – 15 nodes
4. Mesh Topology – 16 nodes
5. Hybrid Topology – 20 nodes (Star + Bus)

Each topology is implemented in C++ and visualized using NetAnim.
Screenshots of outputs are included.
